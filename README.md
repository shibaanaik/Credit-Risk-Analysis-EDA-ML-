# Credit-Risk-Analysis-EDA-ML-

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict credit risk using Machine Learning and visualize key insights with Power BI. By leveraging Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression, the model classifies borrowers as low-risk or high-risk, helping financial institutions make informed decisions.

🔍 Key Steps & Methodology

1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

Analyzed missing values, outliers, and correlations.

Identified trends in income, debt, and default rates.

Visualized key insights using Seaborn & Matplotlib.

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Standardization ⚙️

Handled missing values and imbalanced data.

Converted categorical variables into numerical format.

Standardized numerical features to improve model performance.

3️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation 🤖

Implemented Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.

Trained models on preprocessed data and compared performance.

Achieved an accuracy of 82% on the test set.

4️⃣ Power BI Dashboard for Business Insights 📊

Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:

Default risk analysis

Debt-to-Income (DTI) trends

income Vs age trend

Enabled better financial decision-making through data-driven insights.
